I'm a ML/DL enthusiast and I have just finished my **MSc Data Analytics Graduate** and i am learning day in day out, even while i sleep(no joke..I'm serious..I mean my models do).My blogs/writings are a way to describe my thought process while i learn something new, especially in the field of Machine Learning, AI and Data Science.

I am currently learning quite a bit about Computer Vision and also on the implementation of AI in the healthcare system, which might lead to posts regarding the new technologies that is being used in medical science to mitigate with challenges through the help of AI.

My target as of now is to keep myself healthy and to continue to contribute as much as i can towards the open source community out there and gain from them as well.

As of something that keeps me pushing forward is always the will to learn. My _ikigai_!

I also post my blogs on medium: [Check here..](https://riesler.medium.com/few-basic-ideas-of-core-features-in-python-27bc62721009)

Oh make sure to check out my [projects](/projects/). I have made some and also on the process of creating more. Reach out to me through my LinkedIn.
A few more details about me below.
